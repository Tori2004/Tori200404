My personal respository


# 👋 Hi, I'm Victoria Leyva!

🎓 Junior at California Baptist University  
💻 Major: Accounting | Minor: Computer Science
🔐 Aspiring Data Analytics | Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Tech Advocate

I’m passionate about creating meaningful, secure, and impactful software solutions. Whether it’s through Python, C++, or mobile apps with Flutter, I enjoy using technology to solve real-world problems and elevate user experiences.

🧠 From earning first place in a Titanic Machine Learning Challenge to coordinating at FIRST LEGO League, I’m always learning and building. I enjoy collaborating in student orgs like SWE and advocating for diversity in tech.

💡In order to continue developing technically, make a significant contribution to a software team, and work on worthwhile projects, I'm looking for a summer internship in 2026. I would love to connect with you if you have any leads or advice!

### ✨ Fun Fact  

Usually, I'm riding horses, mentoring young students at local STEM events, or sipping a caramel iced coffee while coding to The Smiths.  As a former water polo player, I also think that grace and grit go hand in hand in both software and sports.
